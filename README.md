# Websockets_RTC
## Demo app: WebSockets + WebRTC study rooms
- Tutorial materials live in `./tutorial` for learning the stack and patterns.
- Demo backend runs from `./demo/server` (Node) to provide WebSocket signaling and room coordination.
- Demo frontend lives in `./demo/client` (React) for the study room UI and WebRTC streams.
- Run the backend by installing dependencies, setting any required env vars, and starting the Node server locally.
- Run the frontend by installing dependencies, pointing it at the backend URL, and launching the React dev server.
